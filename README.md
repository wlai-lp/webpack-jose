webpack starter
- npm install -D webpack webpack-cli
- npm init -y
- git init
- [add gitignore]
- create \src\index.js, add console.log
- create \dist folder
- run `npx webpack`
- it should generate main.js in dist
- node \dist\main.js works


color.js might be a working example
after webpack node-jose into main.js, it should be something like (()=>minifieldjst...)
create a new function in color class and paste everything from main.js

also run it like faas lamda

see color.js for example
